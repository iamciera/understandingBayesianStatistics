## Distribution
**beta distribution** - family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0,1] <br />
**conjugate distribution** - if the prior and and posterior distribution are in the same family <br />
**joint probability distribution** - the probability distribution of all combinations of two or more random variables. <br />
**stationary distribution** - A Markov chain will have a stationary distribution, meaning that if a chain is iterated for a sufficient period, the states it visits will tend to a specific probability distribution  that no longer depends on iteration number.<br />
**conditional distribution** - probability distribution for a sub-population.  It shows the probability that a randomly selected  item in a sub-population has a characteristic that you are interested in.<br />

## Prior
**improper prior** - distribution does not integrate to 1 <br />
**proper prior** distribution does integrate to 1 <br />

## Other    
**random variable** - A quantity that might take any range of values (discrete or continuous) that cannot be predicted with certainty, but only described probabilistically. <br />
**point estimate** - A summary of the location of a parameter value in a Bayesian setting.  This is generally the mean, mode, or median of the posterior distribution.<br />
**hierarchal bayesian model** - in standard Bayesian modes the parameters are drawn from prior distribution.  In hierarchal models these parameters (hyper parameters) are also free to vary from hyper prior.<br />
**marginal likelihood** - distribution of the observed data marginalized over the parameters.
